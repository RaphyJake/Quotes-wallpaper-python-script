And now she knows she'll never be afraid\nTo watch the morning paper blow.\nInto a hole that noone can escape.
"Alison", I said,"we're sinking.."
When i look at you - oh, I don't know what's real
And this is the room one afternoon I knew I could love you\nAnd from above you how I sank into your soul\nInto that secret place where no one dares to go
But there's not hope for me, I've been set free\nThere's no breeze,\nthere's no ship on my sea
Pretty boys with their sunshine faces\nCarrying their head down\nTiptoe down to the lonely places\nWhere you going now?
Oh, but I don't know what's real\nWon't stand a while\nAnd you make me laugh
Turn my head\nInto sound
Who knows? Not me! I've never lost control\nYour face, to face, with the man who sold the world
