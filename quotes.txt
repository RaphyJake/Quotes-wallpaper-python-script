And now she knows she'll never be afraid\nTo watch the morning paper blow.\nInto a hole that noone can escape.
"Alison", I said,"we're sinking.."
When i look at you - oh, I don't know what's real
And this is the room one afternoon I knew I could love you\nAnd from above you how I sank into your soul\nInto that secret place where no one dares to go
