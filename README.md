# Quotes-wallpaper-python-script
Small python script made to generate simple wallpapers with quotes from a txt file.

**Installation:**

install Python3 and Python Image Library (PIL or PILLOW).

If your distro doesn't have PIL in its repos, then open a python console as administrator and type

`pip3 install pillow`

Make sure the script is executable.

Quotes are taken from the quotes.txt file, one per line. You can insert a `\n` character anywhere in your quote.
